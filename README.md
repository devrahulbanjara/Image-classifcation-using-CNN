# Image-classifcation-using-CNN

This repository contains an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images categorized into 10 distinct classes, making it an ideal benchmark for evaluating image classification models. The project covers the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, providing a comprehensive guide for building and fine-tuning CNNs for image classification tasks.

The CNN architecture in this project is designed with customizable layers, including convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. Training the model involves configuring various hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. The repository includes scripts for efficient data preprocessing, training, and evaluating the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualization tools are also provided to track training and validation loss, accuracy over epochs, and to display examples of correct and incorrect classifications.

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. The CIFAR-10 dataset will be automatically downloaded and preprocessed by the provided data loader scripts. Use the Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step implementation and experimentation, and the training scripts in the src directory to train the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Evaluate the model’s performance using the included evaluation scripts. This repository aims to offer a solid foundation for anyone looking to explore image classification with CNNs using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
