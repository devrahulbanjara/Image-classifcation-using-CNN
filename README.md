# Image-classifcation-using-CNN
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. This project demonstrates the entire workflow of building, training, and evaluating a CNN model on CIFAR-10.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Efficiently preprocess CIFAR-10 image data to ensure it is in a suitable format for training the CNN model.
Model Architecture: Implementation of a CNN model with customizable layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Training: Training the CNN model using CIFAR-10 image data, with options to configure hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
Evaluation: Assessing the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Visualization of training and validation loss, accuracy over epochs, and examples of correct and incorrect classifications.
Documentation: Comprehensive documentation and comments within the code to help understand the flow and functionality of the model.
Usage Guide: Step-by-step instructions on how to use the repository, including setup, data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
